simplicity in a minimal standardized approach to creating content

THE MYTH
<p>In Greek mythology, Gaia in mythology (etymology from Ancient Greek "earth") was the personification of the Earth and one of the Greek primordial deities. Gaia was the great mother of all: the primal Greek Mother Goddess; creator and giver of birth to the Earth and all the Universe; the heavenly gods, the Titans, and the Giants were born to her. </p><p>
</p><p>As any myth that is based on facts, discoveries and inventions, gaiacms has the vision to become a CMS and a platform bridging web and mobile technologies. Gaia is intended to be the root system for creating apps and websites and a creative lab where other elements can exist.&nbsp;</p>****

ARCHITECTURE
<p>Gaia's purpose to be the root system for creating apps and websites and a creative lab where other elements can exist and other systems could co-exist.&nbsp;<b>gaiacms</b> wants to inspire simple users and tech-specilized programmers at the passion of creativity. It want users to utilize the system to create something higher. So except from giving the maximum possible customization ability, it avoids giving interface libraries, but the tools to create one for each own.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Template</b> is a construction of <b>pages</b>&nbsp;and pages are constructions of <b>modules</b>&nbsp;or <b>custom html </b>through a wysiwyg editor.&nbsp;</p><p>Copying modules between templates, a template wizard and existant html5 integration to gaiacms makes template creation faster.&nbsp;</p><p>Available features at the custom version are:<br></p><ul><li style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; direction: ltr; line-height: 15.12px;"><b>template wizard and styler </b>to start a template.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; direction: ltr; line-height: 15.12px;"><b>modulized content and stylesheets</b> with <b>pages </b>and <b>modules, for greate variety and custom user design.</b></li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; direction: ltr; line-height: 15.12px;"><span lang="en-US"><b>utilizes 5 databases and key-stores</b>, with&nbsp;</span>MYSQL on the middle of the system.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; direction: ltr; line-height: 15.12px;"><span lang="en-US"><b>cache system for creater performance&nbsp;</b>with 2 key-stores (Redis, Memcached).</span></li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; direction: ltr; line-height: 15.12px;"><span lang="en-US"><b>easy dashboard </b>for the greatest user control and with user permissions.</span></li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; direction: ltr; line-height: 15.12px;"><b>custom template and module </b>creation.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; direction: ltr; line-height: 15.12px;"><b>template integration </b>converting an existant html5&nbsp;template to php-js gaiacms template&nbsp;</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; direction: ltr; line-height: 15.12px;">custom taxonomy groups, &nbsp;post types, user roles for <b>greater content abstraction</b>.</li><li style="margin-bottom: 0.11in; direction: ltr; line-height: 15.12px;">optimized<b> php and javascript libraries</b> to take advantage of.</li></ul>

Both of then are currently under integration for gaiacms Analytics and Statistics and other various services that are currently developed.</p></p>

VAR-PAGE
<p>Pagevars are placed asynchronously, appended to the id attribute on each html tag that is created by webmaster. &nbsp;</p><p>Variables of pages are localized. Default language is english(en). Also greek (el) is installed at varpage table.</p><p>When someone changes template, he expects that vars would be the same the different html, differently everything has to be rewritten from scratch.</p><p>In next gaiacms version, local page will be added, with the choice to add/remove language(s).</p>

PAGE-LINK
<blockquote><b>pagelink</b> is the awesome link of the page after the domain url.<br><b>pagefile </b>is the php file connected with the pagelink at menupage table.</blockquote>

VAR-GLOBALS
<p>are global variables common for any template, any page, any language.</p><p>Are installed synchonously through php method is().</p>

AWESOME 
<p>Links has to be SEO oriented. There are at least two ways to organize links:</p><blockquote>(a) SITE_URL/post/postname - SITE_URL/taxonomy/taxonomy-name<br>(b) SITE_URL/postname - SITE_URL/taxonomy-name</blockquote><p>While the the second choice is simpler to use and delicate, it is more demanding, because it has to check all types of links, every time the system needs to produce one page.</p><blockquote>1) taxonomy arrays&nbsp;<br>2) post uri arrays&nbsp;<br>3) custom pages uri arrays<br>4) apps uri arrays<br>5) user array</blockquote><p>to find the url type.</p><p>Of course this data needs to be cached. But even, when the website is becoming larger conflicts are becoming larger, too.</p><p>So, even the system uses the (a) method with the following $_GET['page'] url types:</p><p>postgroup name from postgrp for posts that produces single posts =&gt; SITE_URL/[postgroup]/[postname]</p><p>taxgroup from taxgrp for taxonomies that produces archieves &nbsp;=&gt; SITE_URL/[taxgroup]/[taxname]</p><p>usergroup from usergrp for users that produces user profiles &nbsp;=&gt; SITE_URL/[usergroup]/[username]</p><p>page from pages that produces custom page pages =&gt; SITE_URL/page/[pageuri]</p><p>The problem that arises is what happens when the second uri level: post, page,taxonomy etc, changes it's name?<br></p><p>Even if we preserve the third uri level (eg post uri), the second level is very easy to change, eg when website grows and new taxonomies are added. All saved and bookmarked and internal links are mistaken.&nbsp;</p><p>The solution gaiacms follows to this is to create and cache a big array of preserved names with merged arrays from all the above groups and to keep urls with two levels. At least that is the starting point, using the Redis caching hand.<br></p>
